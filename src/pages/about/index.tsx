            I'm Matheus Raduan, a Frontend Developer based in Brazil üáßüá∑ and for
            7 years I've been solving problems by design and building web
            experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have experience since working with digital agency (audaz), passing
            by a brazilian big tech product company as iFood (group Movile), and
            with huge client to CI&T, attending EMEA market (Europe, the Middle
            East and Africa).
          </p>
          <p>
            The main stack that I‚Äôve been worked is React, Next.js, Gatsby,
            Vue.js, Typescript, React Query, CSS-in-JS, Jest (TDD), Material UI,
            Contentful and designing REST APIs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recently I've been focusing on Clean Architecture for the frontend
            environment.
          </p>
          <p>Nice to meet you! üòÑ</p>
          <h1>A little bit about my history</h1>
          <p>I like design.</p>
          <p> I grew up drawing a lot, since when I was a kid.</p>
          <p>
            In the highschool I almost reprove an specific class because I only
            draw in the school üòÖ. But don't take me wrong! Give me a chance, I
            faced this seriously, I was decided to be a illustrator or work with
            design. For the good, some results start to show earlier.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I was coursing the techinician degree of informatics (in my
            high school), because the fame of my illustrations one of my arts
            was ellected to be launched as a t-shirt print to a digital company
            called Camiseteria (if it were in english would be something like
            T-shirtting ).
          </p>
          <p>
            This was a great achievement to me, I was only with 15 years and
            some people would buy a t-shirt with my illustration üòÄ. So I
            decided to focus only on illustration and study design, and even
            started a Visual Communication technical course that contains the
            core of a Graphic Design degree, how I liked that course.

              <h2>The game change</h2>
              <p>
                As I mentioned, in that time I already coursed my techinician
                degree of informatics. <br /> So I was open too to work with
                some tech stuff, and because of great friendship of a brother of
                the church that influenced me a lot, I started to create
                websites and work as freelance to him for one entire year.{' '}
                <br /> It was awesome and a great experience. He really invested
                in my carrer.
              </p>
              <p>
                That was the way that found the place where I could put the two
                things that I like working together, <b>coding</b> and
                <b> design</b>. <br /> I found what I wanted to work and live üòÑ

          <p>
            I believe that we always work for someone and the Person I work for
            is bigger than my own work. The question you should ask me is, who
            do you work for?
