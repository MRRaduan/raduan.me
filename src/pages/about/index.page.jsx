          <p>Nice to meet you! üòÑ</p>
          <h1>A little bit about my history</h1>
          <p>I like design.</p>
          <p> I grew up drawing a lot, since when I was a kid.</p>
          <p>
            In the highschool I almost reprove an specific class because I only
            draw in the school üòÖ. But don&apos;t take me wrong! Give me a
            chance, I faced this seriously, I was decided to be a illustrator or
            work with design. For the good, some results start to show earlier.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I was coursing the techinician degree of informatics (in my
            high school), because the fame of my illustrations one of my arts
            was ellected to be launched as a t-shirt print to a digital company
            called Camiseteria (if this name were in english would be something
            like <i>T-shirtting</i>).
          </p>
          <p>
            This was a great achievement to me, I was only with 15 years and
            some people would buy a t-shirt with my illustration üòÄ. So I
            decided to focus only on illustration and study design, and even
            started a Visual Communication technical course that contains the
            core of a Graphic Design degree, how I liked that course.

              <h2>The game change</h2>
              <p>
                As I mentioned, in that time I already coursed my techinician
                degree of informatics. <br /> So I also was open to work with
                some tech stuff, and because of great friendship of a brother of
                the church, that influenced me a lot, I started to create
                websites and work as freelance to him for one entire year.
                <br /> It was awesome and a great experience. He really invested
                in my carrer (thanks Diego Neves ü•≤)
              </p>
              <p>
                That was the way that found the place where I could put the two
                things that I like working together, <b>coding</b> and
                <b> design</b>. <br /> I found what I wanted to work and live üòÑ

          <p>
            I believe that we always work for someone, and the Person that I
            work for is bigger than my own work. The question that you may ask
            me is: who do you work for?
